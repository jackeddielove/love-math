                I started tutoring 20 years ago as a student at City College of San Francisco.
                I have fond memories of that room in the library basement.
                It was a hive of activity, where students would take a number like in a deli.
                It was exciting to call out the next number, push the “Now serving” button, and walk over to the student with the raised hand.
                It was a chance to help someone, share my knowledge and experience, and connect.
                <p>
                Not much has changed since then. After three degrees and a bunch of teaching experience, it's still about helping, sharing, and connecting.
                <p>
                It's a special moment when a student's eyes light up with new understanding. When this happens, you are doing more than learning math. You are learning something about yourself and what you're capable of.

                - Sacha, San Francisco State University graduate
            <p>
                My son is always after the easy answer, and he's learned to dread any math that requires effort. He starts every session dragging his feet, but when I return at the end, he's engaged and doing the work. Jack uses the last 10 minutes to show him a real-world, hands-on math application to make it fun and relevant. Jack's made a real difference in how my son sees math &mdash; and in how willing he is to try.

            "We've been so grateful for the consistent support and guidance Jack has provided my daughter over the past few months. He is incredibly patient and has a wonderful sense of humor that makes learning fun and engaging. My 11-year-old genuinely enjoys working with him and looks forward to her sessions. This says a lot for a kid with dyscalculia, never would I have thought that she would look forward to anything math related. In a short time, she has grown in her understanding of math. We're so appreciative of his dedication, kindness, and ability to make the tough concepts feel manageable. I highly recommend Jack if you're looking for a tutor that might be a math whisperer!"

                Curricular Sessions
            <p>
                Curricular sessions focus on the student's current academic work. We go over homework, study for quizzes and tests, and strengthen our understanding of the course material. If a student is preparing for a future course, I research the course's learning outcomes and create lessons toward that end. Either way, I am careful to note student strengths and weaknesses and plan lessons accordingly.

                Extra-curricular Sessions
            <p>
                Extra-curricular sessions expand the student's idea of what mathematics is and what it means to "do math". Mathematics is more than a system of symbols and rules. It is a creative process that we can participate in and engage with in a variety of ways. The lessons are often spontaneous and responsive to student interest in different topics. We may explore higher dimensions, infinity, art, symmetry, or a variety of other subjects missing from the standard school curriculum. We often co-create mathematical artifacts using craft materials or digital platforms.

        My logo is based on a mutable object I created in my art studio in 2020. I discovered this object while using folded posterboard to explore the relationship between two classical 3-dimensional solids, the cube and the octahedron. The images you see here are all the same object, just folded up on itself in different ways. I chose this as my logo because it captures the essence of doing mathematics. We start with what we know, we ask questions about what we don't, and we try things and see what happens.
